                  specimens and the use of laser-capture
                  microdissection for selecting cell populations for
                  RNA extraction have increased over the past few
                  years. Both these methods contribute to RNA
                  degradation. Therefore, quality assessments of RNA
                  hybridized to microarrays are becoming increasingly
                  more important. Existing methods for estimating the
                  quality of RNA hybridized to a GeneChip, from
                  resulting microarray data, suffer from subjectivity
                  and lack of estimates of variabili ty. In this
                  article, a method for assessing RNA quality for a
                  hybridized array which overcomes these drawbacks is
                  proposed. The effe ctiveness of the proposed method
                  is demonstrated by the application of the method to
                  two microarray data sets for which external ver
                  ification of RNA quality is known. },

                  genomes. One class of these elements, the human
                  endogenous retr oviruses (HERVs), is comprised of
                  remnants of ancient exogenous retroviruses that have
                  gained access to the germ line. Afte r integration,
                  most proviruses have been the subject of numerous
                  amplifications and have suffered extensive deletions
                  and m utations. Nevertheless, HERV-derived
                  transcripts and proteins have been detected in
                  healthy and diseased human tissues, and HERV-K, the
                  youngest, most conserved family, is able to form
                  virus-like particles. Although it is generally
                  accepted that the integration of retroelements can
                  cause significant harm by disrupting or
                  disregulating essential genes, the role of HER V
                  expression in the etiology of malignancies and
                  autoimmune and neurologic diseases remains
                  controversial. In recent years, striking evidence
                  has accumulated indicating that some proviral
                  sequences and HERV proteins might even serve the
                  needs of the host and are therefore under positive
                  selection. The remarkable progress in the analysis
                  of host genomes has brought to light the significant
                  impact of HERVs and other retroelements on genetic
                  variation, genome evolution, and gene regulation. },

                  logarithmically. Measurements of real world values
                  are often distributed logarithmically (or
                  equivalently, the logarithm of the measurements is
                  distributed uniformly).  This counter-intuitive
                  result has been found to apply to a wide variety of
                  data sets, including electricity bills, street
                  addresses, stock prices, population numbers, death
                  rates, lengths of rivers, physical and mathematical
                  constants, and processes described by power laws
                  (which are very common in nature). The result holds
                  regardless of the base in which the numbers are
                  expressed, although the exact proportions change.
                  It is named after physicist Frank Benford, who
                  stated it in 1938, although it had been previously
                  stated by Simon Newcomb in 1881 (see Newcomb1881).}

                  microarrays, rely on precise probe-target
                  interactions to ensure specific and accurate
                  measurement of RNA expression. Polymorphisms present
                  in the probe-target sequences have been shown to
                  alter probe- hybridization affinities, leading to
                  reduced signal intensity measurements and resulting
                  in false-positive results. Here, we characterize
                  this effect on exon and gene expression estimates
                  derived from the Affymetrix Exon Array. We conducted
                  an association analysis between expression levels of
                  probes, exons and transcripts and the genotypes of
                  neighboring SNPs in 57 CEU HapMap individuals. We
                  quantified the dependence of the effect of genotype
                  on signal intensity with respect to the number of
                  polymorphisms within target sequences, number of
                  affected probes and position of the polymorphism
                  within each probe. The effect of SNPs is quite
                  severe and leads to considerable false-positive
                  rates, particularly when the analysis is performed
                  at the exon level and aimed at detecting alternative
                  splicing events. Finally, we propose simple
                  solutions, based on masking' probes, which are
                  putatively affected by polymorphisms and show that
                  such strategy results in a large decrease in
                  false-positive rates, with a very modest reduction
                  in coverage of the transcriptome. },

                  represents an opportunity for deciphering the
                  interplay between structural and functional
                  organization of genomes and for discovering novel
                  biomarkers. However, the development of integrative
                  approaches to complement gene expression (GE) data
                  with other types of gene information, such as copy
                  number (CN) and chromosomal localization, still
                  represents a computational challenge in the genomic
                  arena. This work presents a computational procedure
                  that directly integrates CN and GE profiles at
                  genome-wide level. When applied to DNA/RNA paired
                  data, this approach leads to the identification of
                  Significant Overlaps of Differentially Expressed and
                  Genomic Imbalanced Regions (SODEGIR). This goal is
                  accomplished in three steps. The first step extends
                  to CN a method for detecting regional imbalances in
                  GE. The second part provides the integration of CN
                  and GE data and identifies chromosomal regions with
                  concordantly altered genomic and transcriptional
                  status in a tumor sample. The last step elevates the
                  single-sample analysis to an entire dataset of tumor
                  specimens. When applied to study chromosomal
                  aberrations in a collection of astrocytoma and renal
                  carcinoma samples, the procedure proved to be
                  effective in identifying discrete chromosomal
                  regions of coordinated CN alterations and changes in
                  transcriptional levels.  },

  abstract =	 {Metabolism is the process of converting nutrients
                  into usable energy and the building blocks of
                  cellular structures. Although the biochemical
                  reactions of metabolism are well characterized, the
                  ways in which metabolism is regulated and regulates
                  other biological processes remain incompletely
                  understood. In particular, the extent to which
                  metabolite concentrations are related to the
                  production of gene products is an open question. To
                  address this question, we have measured the dynamics
                  of both metabolites and gene products in yeast in
                  response to two different environmental stresses. We
                  find a strong coordination of the responses of
                  metabolites and functionally related gene
                  products. The nature of this correlation (e.g.,
                  whether it is direct or inverse) depends on the type
                  of metabolite (e.g., amino acid versus glycolytic
                  compound) and the kind of stress to which the cells
                  were subjected. We have used our observations of
                  these dependencies to design a Bayesian algorithm
                  that predicts functional relationships between
                  metabolites and genes directly from experimental
                  data. This approach lays the groundwork for a
                  systems-level understanding of metabolism and its
                  regulation by (and of) gene product levels. Such an
                  understanding would be valuable for metabolic
                  engineering and for understanding and treating
                  metabolic diseases. },

                  intent of model-based inference should determine
                  whether AIC or BIC is used. Various facets of such

                  profiles can be used for the classification,
                  diagnosis, and prognosis of human malignancies. Loss
                  or amplification of miRNA genes has been reported in
                  a variety of cancers, and altered patterns of miRNA
                  expression may affect cell cycle and survival
                  programs. Germ-line and somatic mutations in miRNAs
                  or polymorphisms in the mRNAs targeted by miRNAs may
                  also contribute to cancer predisposition and
                  progression. We propose that alterations in miRNA

                  their functions, standardized descriptions of mouse
                  phenotypes, extensive integration of DNA and protein

                  and genome variant information including comparative
                  data on mammalian genes. Data within MGD are

                  curation of the biomedical literature, direct
                  contributions from individual investigator's
                  laboratories and major informatics resource centers

                  first cancer with comprehensive genomic profiles
                  mapped by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. A
                  central challenge in large-scale genome projects,
                  such as the TCGA GBM project, is the ability to
                  distinguish cancer-causing <80><9C>driver<80><9D>
                  mutations from passively selected
                  <80><9C>passenger<80><9D> mutations. Principal
                  Findings <p>In contrast to a purely frequency based
                  approach to identifying driver mutations in cancer,
                  we propose an automated network-based approach for
                  identifying candidate oncogenic processes and driver
                  genes. The approach is based on the hypothesis that
                  cellular networks contain functional modules, and
                  that tumors target specific modules critical to
                  their growth. Key elements in the approach include
                  combined analysis of sequence mutations and DNA copy
                  number alterations; use of a unified molecular
                  interaction network consisting of both
                  protein-protein interactions and signaling pathways;
                  and identification and statistical assessment of
                  network modules, i.e. cohesive groups of genes of
                  interest with a higher density of interactions
                  within groups than between groups. Conclusions <p>We
                  confirm and extend the observation that GBM
                  alterations tend to occur within specific functional
                  modules, in spite of considerable patient-to-patient
                  variation, and that two of the largest modules
                  involve signaling via p53, Rb, PI3K and receptor
                  protein kinases. We also identify new candidate
                  drivers in GBM, including AGAP2/CENTG1, a putative
                  oncogene and an activator of the PI3K pathway; and,
                  three additional significantly altered modules,
                  including one involved in microtubule
                  organization. To facilitate the application of our
                  network-based approach to additional cancer types,
                  we make the method freely available as part of a
                  software tool called NetBox.</p> </sec>},

                  pathway-specific interpretations for understanding
                  the functional relevance of gene alterations in
                  human cancers. Although signaling activities are
                  often conceptualized as linear events, in reality,
                  they reflect the activity of complex functional
                  networks assembled from modules that each respond to
                  input signals. To acquire a deeper understanding of
                  this network structure, we developed an approach to
                  deconstruct pathways into modules represented by
                  gene expression signatures. Our studies confirm that
                  they represent units of underlying biological
                  activity linked to known biochemical pathway
                  structures. Importantly, we show that these
                  signaling modules provide tools to dissect the
                  complexity of oncogenic states that define disease
                  outcomes as well as response to pathway-specific
                  therapeutics. We propose that this model of pathway
                  structure constitutes a framework to study the
                  processes by which information propogates through
                  cellular networks and to elucidate the relationships
                  of fundamental modules to cellular and clinical

                  and epigenetic processes during carcinogenesis, but
                  the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. By
                  creating an integrated prostate cancer epigenome map
                  using tiling arrays, we show that contiguous regions
                  of gene suppression commonly occur through
                  long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES). We
                  identified 47 LRES regions in prostate cancer,
                  typically spanning about 2 Mb and harbouring
                  approximately 12 genes, with a prevalence of tumour
                  suppressor and miRNA genes. Our data reveal that
                  LRES is associated with regional histone
                  deacetylation combined with subdomains of different
                  epigenetic remodelling patterns, which include
                  re-enforcement, gain or exchange of repressive
                  histone, and DNA methylation marks. The
                  transcriptional and epigenetic state of genes in
                  normal prostate epithelial and human embryonic stem
                  cells can play a critical part in defining the mode
                  of cancer-associated epigenetic remodelling. We
                  propose that consolidation or effective reduction of
                  the cancer genome commonly occurs in domains through
                  a combination of LRES and LOH or genomic deletion,
                  resulting in reduced transcriptional plasticity

  abstract =	 {Elucidating the biogeography of bacterial
                  communities on the human body is critical for
                  establishing healthy baselines from which to detect
                  differences associated with diseases. To obtain an
                  integrated view of the spatial and temporal
                  distribution of the human microbiota, we surveyed
                  bacteria from up to 27 sites in seven to nine
                  healthy adults on four occasions. We found that
                  community composition was determined primarily by
                  body habitat. Within habitats, interpersonal
                  variability was high, whereas individuals exhibited
                  minimal temporal variability. Several skin locations
                  harbored more diverse communities than the gut and
                  mouth, and skin locations differed in their
                  community assembly patterns. These results indicate
                  that our microbiota, although personalized, varies
                  systematically across body habitats and time; such
                  trends may ultimately reveal how microbiome changes
                  cause or prevent disease.},

                  for implicating novel gene ensembles in cellular
                  mechanisms of health and disease. The most popular
                  platform for genome-wide expression profiling is the
                  Affymetrix GeneChip. However, its selection of
                  probes relied on earlier genome and transcriptome
                  annotation which is significantly different from
                  current knowledge. The resultant informatics
                  problems have a profound impact on analysis and
                  interpretation the data. Here, we address these
                  critical issues and offer a solution. We identified
                  several classes of problems at the individual probe
                  level in the existing annotation, under the
                  assumption that current genome and transcriptome
                  databases are more accurate than those used for
                  GeneChip design. We then reorganized probes on more
                  than a dozen popular GeneChips into gene-,
                  transcript- and exon-specific probe sets in light of
                  up-to-date genome, cDNA/EST clustering and single
                  nucleotide polymorphism information. Comparing
                  analysis results between the original and the
                  redefined probe sets reveals [~]30-50% discrepancy
                  in the genes previously identified as differentially
                  expressed, regardless of analysis method. Our
                  results demonstrate that the original Affymetrix
                  probe set definitions are inaccurate, and many
                  conclusions derived from past GeneChip analyses may
                  be significantly flawed. It will be beneficial to
                  re-analyze existing GeneChip data with updated probe
                  set definitions. },

                  much more of this `junk' DNA than actual coding
                  DNA. The majority of these elements utilize an RNA
                  intermediate and are termed retroelements. Most of
                  these retroelements appear to amplify in
                  evolutionary wa ves that insert in the genome and
                  then gradually diverge. In humans, almost half of
                  the genome is recognizably derived from
                  retroelements, with the two elements that are
                  currently actively amplifying, L1 and Alu, making up
                  about 25\% of the genome and contributing
                  extensively to disease. The mechanisms of this
                  amplification process are beginning to be
                  understood, alth ough there are still more questions
                  than answers. Insertion of new retroelements may
                  directly damage the genome, and the pr esence of
                  multiple copies of these elements throughout the
                  genome has longer-term influences on recombination

  ABSTRACT =	 {BACKGROUND:When analyzing complex biological
                  systems, a major objective is localization of
                  function - assessing how much each element
                  contributes to the execution of specific tasks. To
                  establish causal relationships, knockout and
                  perturbation studies are commonly executed. The vast
                  majority of studies perturb a single element at a
                  time, yet one may hypothesize that in non-trivial
                  biological systems single-perturbations will fail to
                  reveal the functional organization of the system,
                  owing to interactions and redundancies.RESULTS:We
                  address this fundamental gap between theory and
                  practice by quantifying how misleading the picture
                  arising from classical single-perturbation analysis
                  is, compared with the full multiple-perturbations
                  picture. To this end we use a combination of a novel
                  approach for quantitative, rigorous
                  multiple-knockouts analysis based on the Shapley
                  value from game theory, with an established
                  in-silico model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
                  metabolism. We find that single-perturbations
                  analysis misses at least 33% of the genes that
                  contribute significantly to the growth potential of
                  this organism, though the essential genes it does
                  find are responsible for most of the growth
                  potential. But when assigning gene contributions for
                  individual metabolic functions, the picture arising
                  from single-perturbations is severely lacking and a
                  multiple-perturbations approach turns out to be
                  essential.CONCLUSION:The multiple-perturbations
                  investigation yields a significantly richer and more
                  biologically plausible functional annotation of the
                  genes comprising the metabolic network of the
                  yeast.}

                  microarray data analysis often do not answer the
                  specific questions of interest to a biologist. Such
                  specific questions could be derived from other
                  information sources, including expert prior
                  knowledge. More specifically, given a set of seed
                  genes which are believed to have a common function,
                  we would like to recruit genes with similar
                  expression profiles as the seed genes in a
                  significant subset of experimental
                  conditions. Results: We introduce QDB, a novel
                  Bayesian query-driven biclustering framework in
                  which the prior distributions allow introducing
                  knowledge from a set of seed genes (query) to guide
                  the pattern search. In two well-known yeast
                  compendia, we grow highly functionally enriched
                  biclusters from small sets of seed genes using a
                  resolution sweep approach. In addition, relevant
                  conditions are identified and modularity of the
                  biclusters is demonstrated, including the discovery
                  of overlapping modules. Finally, our method deals
                  with missing values naturally, performs well on
                  artificial data from a recent biclustering benchmark
                  study and has a number of conceptual advantages when
                  compared to existing approaches for focused module

  abstract =	 {Novel sequencing technologies permit the rapid
                  production of large sequence data sets. These
                  technologies are likely to revolutionize genetics
                  and biomedical research, but a thorough
                  characterization of the ultra-short read output is
                  necessary. We generated and analyzed two Illumina 1G
                  ultra-short read data sets, i.e. 2.8 million 27mer
                  reads from a Beta vulgaris genomic clone and 12.3
                  million 36mers from the Helicobacter acinonychis
                  genome. We found that error rates range from 0.3% at
                  the beginning of reads to 3.8% at the end of
                  reads. Wrong base calls are frequently preceded by
                  base G. Base substitution error frequencies vary by
                  10- to 11-fold, with A > C transversion being among
                  the most frequent and C > G transversions among the
                  least frequent substitution errors. Insertions and
                  deletions of single bases occur at very low
                  rates. When simulating re-sequencing we found a
                  20-fold sequencing coverage to be sufficient to
                  compensate errors by correct reads. The read
                  coverage of the sequenced regions is biased; the
                  highest read density was found in intervals with
                  elevated GC content. High Solexa quality scores are
                  over-optimistic and low scores underestimate the
                  data quality. Our results show different types of
                  biases and ways to detect them. Such biases have
                  implications on the use and interpretation of Solexa
                  data, for de novo sequencing, re-sequencing, the
                  identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms
                  and DNA methylation sites, as well as for
                  transcriptome analysis. },

                  <title/> <p>Cancer is a complex disease with many
                  subtypes that differ substantially with respect to
                  their onset, progression, and response to
                  treatment. Better understanding of the etiology and
                  mechanism of cancer should help improve the
                  diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cancer that
                  will kill more than half a million Americans this
                  year alone. Our study illustrates how integration of
                  data over multiple stages and modeling tumorigenesis
                  at the level of regulatory pathways or sets of genes
                  provide robust and interpretable novel hypotheses
                  concerning root genetic causes responsible for
                  cancer initiation, progression, and invasion. Our
                  modeling approach is one of the first approaches
                  that combines multiple microarray datasets in a
                  truly integrative framework that promotes the
                  interpretability of important factors or pathways in
                  one or more datasets. We apply this analysis of
                  tumor progression to both prostate cancer and
                  melanoma to provide information that can lead to the
                  identification of novel biomarkers and give a basis
                  for how genetic disruptions serve to alter actions
                  in specific cell types.</p> </sec> },

                  occurrence in multiple samples. At the same time, a
                  gene function can be changed by aberration of the
                  corresponding gene or modification of microRNA
                  (miRNA) expression, which attenuates the gene. In a
                  large number of cancer samples, these two mechanisms
                  might be distributed in a coordinated and almost
                  mutually exclusive manner. Understanding this
                  coordination may assist in identifying changes which
                  significantly produce the same functional impact on
                  cancer phenotype, and further identify genes that
                  are universally required for cancer. Present
                  methodologies for finding aberrations usually
                  analyze single datasets, which cannot identify such
                  pairs of coordinating genes and miRNAs.  Results: We
                  have developed MIRAGAA, a statistical approach, to
                  assess the coordinated changes of genome copy
                  numbers and miRNA expression. We have evaluated
                  MIRAGAA on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
                  Glioblastoma Multiforme datasets. In these datasets,
                  a number of genome regions coordinating with
                  different miRNAs are identified. Although well known
                  for their biological significance, these genes and
                  miRNAs would be left undetected for being less
                  significant if the two datasets were analyzed
                  individually.  Availability and Implementation: The
                  source code, implemented in R and java, is available

                  whose perturbation contributes to neoplastic
                  transformation remains a fundamental challenge for
                  cancer biology. We show that such pathway
                  perturbations, and the cis-regulatory elements
                  through which they operate, can be efficiently
                  extracted from global gene expression profiles. Our
                  approach utilizes information-theoretic analysis of
                  expression levels, pathways, and genomic
                  sequences. Analysis across a diverse set of human
                  cancers reveals the majority of previously known
                  cancer pathways. Through de novo motif discovery we
                  associate these pathways with transcription-factor
                  binding sites and miRNA targets, including those of
                  E2F, NF-Y, p53, and let-7. Follow-up experiments
                  confirmed that these predictions correspond to
                  functional in vivo regulatory
                  interactions. Strikingly, the majority of the
                  perturbations, associated with putative
                  cis-regulatory elements, fall outside of known
                  cancer pathways. Our study provides a systems-level
                  dissection of regulatory perturbations in cancer an
                  essential component of a rational strategy for
                  therapeutic intervention and drug-target
                  discovery. See also supplement at

                  purposes; however, little is known scientifically
                  about its long-term effects. We previously reported
                  the effects of a double-blind study evaluating the
                  psychological effects of a high psilocybin
                  dose. This report presents the 14-month follow-up
                  and examines the relationship of the follow-up
                  results to data obtained at screening and on drug
                  session days. Participants were 36
                  hallucinogen-naive adults reporting regular
                  participation in religious/ spiritual
                  activities. Oral psilocybin (30 mg/70 kg) was
                  administered on one of two or three sessions, with
                  methylphenidate (40 mg/70 kg) administered on the
                  other session(s). During sessions, volunteers were
                  encouraged to close their eyes and direct their
                  attention inward. At the 14-month follow-up, 58\%
                  and 67\%, respectively, of volunteers rated the
                  psilocybin-occasioned experience as being among the
                  five most personally meaningful and among the five
                  most spiritually significant experiences of their

                  well-being or life satisfaction; 58\% met criteria
                  for having had a 'complete' mystical
                  experience. Correlation and regression analyses
                  indicated a central role of the mystical experience
                  assessed on the session day in the high ratings of
                  personal meaning and spiritual significance at
                  follow-up. Of the measures of personality, affect,
                  quality of life and spirituality assessed across the
                  study, only a scale measuring mystical experience
                  showed a difference from screening. When
                  administered under supportive conditions, psilocybin
                  occasioned experiences similar to spontaneously
                  occurring mystical experiences that, at 14-month
                  follow-up, were considered by volunteers to be among
                  the most personally meaningful and spiritually
                  significant of their lives. },

  abstract =	 {The alternative splicing code that controls and
                  coordinates the transcriptome in complex
                  multicellular organisms remains poorly
                  understood. It has long been argued that regulation
                  of alternative splicing relies on combinatorial
                  interactions between multiple proteins, and that
                  tissue-specific splicing decisions most likely
                  result from differences in the concentration and/or
                  activity of these proteins. However, large-scale
                  data to systematically address this issue have just
                  recently started to become available. Here we show
                  that splicing factor gene expression signatures can
                  be identified that reflect cell type and
                  tissue-specific patterns of alternative splicing. We
                  used a computational approach to analyze
                  microarray-based gene expression profiles of
                  splicing factors from mouse, chimpanzee and human
                  tissues. Our results show that brain and testis, the
                  two tissues with highest levels of alternative
                  splicing events, have the largest number of splicing
                  factor genes that are most highly differentially
                  expressed. We further identified SR protein kinases
                  and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP)
                  proteins among the splicing factor genes that are
                  most highly differentially expressed in a particular
                  tissue. These results indicate the power of
                  generating signature-based predictions as an initial
                  computational approach into a global view of
                  tissue-specific alternative splicing regulation.},

  abstract =	 {Studies of the human microbiome have revealed that
                  even healthy individuals differ remarkably in the
                  microbes that occupy habitats such as the gut, skin
                  and vagina. Much of this diversity remains
                  unexplained, although diet, environment, host
                  genetics and early microbial exposure have all been
                  implicated. Accordingly, to characterize the ecology
                  of human-associated microbial communities, the Human
                  Microbiome Project has analysed the largest cohort
                  and set of distinct, clinically relevant body
                  habitats so far. We found the diversity and
                  abundance of each habitat's signature microbes to
                  vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong
                  niche specialization both within and among
                  individuals. The project encountered an estimated
                  81-99\% of the genera, enzyme families and community
                  configurations occupied by the healthy Western
                  microbiome. Metagenomic carriage of metabolic
                  pathways was stable among individuals despite
                  variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial
                  background proved to be one of the strongest
                  associations of both pathways and microbes with
                  clinical metadata. These results thus delineate the
                  range of structural and functional configurations
                  normal in the microbial communities of a healthy
                  population, enabling future characterization of the

                  inflammatory diseases among urban populations
                  worldwide. According to the "biodiversity
                  hypothesis," reduced contact of people with natural

                  adversely affect the human commensal microbiota and

                  random sample of adolescents living in a
                  heterogeneous region of 100 x 150 km, we show that

                  of the bacterial classes on their skin. Compared

                  anti-inflammatory cytokine in immunologic tolerance,
                  in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In healthy,
                  but not in atopic, individuaXls, IL-10 expression
                  was positively correlated with the abundance of the
                  gammaproteobacterial genus Acinetobacter on the
                  skin. These results raise fundamental questions
                  about the consequences of biodiversity loss for both
                  allergic conditions and public health in general.},

  ABSTRACT =	 {BACKGROUND:Cancer is a heterogeneous disease
                  resulting from the accumulation of genetic defects
                  that negatively impact control of cell division,
                  motility, adhesion and apoptosis. Deregulation in
                  signaling along the EgfR-MAPK pathway is common in
                  breast cancer, though the manner in which
                  deregulation occurs variesbetween both individuals
                  and cancer subtypes.RESULTS:We were interested in
                  identifying subnetworks within the EgfR-MAPK pathway
                  that are similarly deregulated across subsets of
                  breast cancers. To that end, we mapped genomic,
                  transcriptional and proteomic profiles for 30 breast
                  cancer cell lines onto a curated Pathway Logic
                  symbolic systems model of EgfR-MAPK signaling. This
                  model was composed of 539 molecular states and 396
                  rules governing signaling between active states. We
                  analyzed these models and identified several
                  subtype-specific subnetworks, including one that
                  suggested Pak1 is particularly important in
                  regulating the MAPK cascade when itis
                  over-expressed. We hypothesized that Pak1
                  over-expressing cell lines would have increased
                  sensitivity to Mek inhibitors. We tested this
                  experimentally by measuring quantitative responses
                  of 20 breast cancer cell lines to three Mek
                  inhibitors. We found that Pak1 over-expressing
                  luminal breast cancer cell lines are significantly
                  more sensitive to Mek inhibition compared to those
                  that express Pak1 at low levels. This indicates
                  thatPak1 over-expression may be a useful clinical
                  marker to identify patient populations that may be
                  sensitive to Mek inhibitors.CONCLUSIONS:All
                  together, our results support the utility of
                  symbolic system biology models for identification of
                  therapeutic approaches that will be effective
                  against breast cancer subsets.}

                  Solexa/Illumina deep sequencing technology and five
                  different microarray platforms. With Illumina's
                  digital gene expression assay, we obtained [~]2.4
                  million sequence tags per sample, their abundance
                  spanning four orders of magnitude. Results were
                  highly reproducible, even across laboratories. With
                  a dedicated Bayesian model, we found differential
                  expression of 3179 transcripts with an estimated
                  false-discovery rate of 8.5%. This is a much higher
                  figure than found for microarrays. The overlap in
                  differentially expressed transcripts found with deep
                  sequencing and microarrays was most significant for
                  Affymetrix. The changes in expression observed by
                  deep sequencing were larger than observed by
                  microarrays or quantitative PCR. Relevant processes
                  such as calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity
                  and vesicle transport along microtubules were found
                  affected by deep sequencing but not by
                  microarrays. While undetectable by microarrays,
                  antisense transcription was found for 51% of all
                  genes and alternative polyadenylation for 47%. We
                  conclude that deep sequencing provides a major
                  advance in robustness, comparability and richness of
                  expression profiling data and is expected to boost

                  in normal human tissues suitable as a reference for
                  defining basic organ systems biology. Using
                  oligonucleotide microarrays, we analyze 59 samples
                  representing 19 distinct tissue types. Of
                  approximately 7,000 genes analyzed, 451 genes are
                  expressed in all tissue types and designated as
                  housekeeping genes. These genes display significant
                  variation in expression levels among tissues and are
                  sufficient for discerning tissue-specific expression
                  signatures, indicative of fundamental differences in
                  biochemical processes. In addition, subsets of
                  tissue-selective genes are identified that define
                  key biological processes characterizing each
                  organ. This compendium highlights similarities and
                  differences among organ systems and different

                  processing and analysis of gene expression data
                  generated using DNA microarrays. This type of
                  experiment allows to determine relative levels of
                  mRNA abundance in a set of tissues or cell
                  populations for thousands of genes
                  simultaneously. Naturally, such an experiment
                  requires computational and statistical analysis
                  techniques. At the outset of the processing
                  pipeline, the computational procedures are largely
                  determined by the technology and experimental setup
                  that are used. Subsequently, as more reliable
                  intensity values for genes emerge, pattern discovery
                  methods come into play. The most striking
                  peculiarity of this kind of data is that one usually
                  obtains measurements for thousands of genes for only
                  a much smaller number of conditions. This is at the
                  root of several of the statistical questions

                  from digital libraries. However, a library has been
                  described as thought in cold storage and
                  unfortunately many digital libraries can be cold,
                  impersonal, isolated, and inaccessible places. In
                  this Review, we discuss the current chilly state of
                  digital libraries for the computational biologist,
                  including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, the ACM digital
                  library, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Citeseer,
                  arXiv, DBLP, and Google Scholar. We illustrate the
                  current process of using these libraries with a
                  typical workflow, and highlight problems with
                  managing data and metadata using URIs. We then
                  examine a range of new applications such as Zotero,
                  Mendeley, Mekentosj Papers, MyNCBI, CiteULike,
                  Connotea, and HubMed that exploit the Web to make
                  these digital libraries more personal, sociable,
                  integrated, and accessible places. We conclude with
                  how these applications may begin to help achieve a
                  digital defrost, and discuss some of the issues that
                  will help or hinder this in terms of making
                  libraries on the Web warmer places in the future,
                  becoming resources that are considerably more useful
                  to both humans and machines.},

  abstract =	 {Human genomic data of many types are readily
                  available, but the complexity and scale of human
                  molecular biology make it difficult to integrate
                  this body of data, understand it from a systems
                  level, and apply it to the study of specific
                  pathways or genetic disorders. An investigator could
                  best explore a particular protein, pathway, or
                  disease if given a functional map summarizing the
                  data and interactions most relevant to his or her
                  area of interest. Using a regularized Bayesian
                  integration system, we provide maps of functional
                  activity and interaction networks in over 200 areas
                  of human cellular biology, each including
                  information from 30,000 genome-scale experiments
                  pertaining to 25,000 human genes. Key to these
                  analyses is the ability to efficiently summarize
                  this large data collection from a variety of
                  biologically informative perspectives: prediction of
                  protein function and functional modules, cross-talk
                  among biological processes, and association of novel
                  genes and pathways with known genetic disorders. In
                  addition to providing maps of each of these areas,
                  we also identify biological processes active in each
                  data set. Experimental investigation of five
                  specific genes, AP3B1, ATP6AP1, BLOC1S1, LAMP2, and
                  RAB11A, has confirmed novel roles for these proteins
                  in the proper initiation of macroautophagy in amino
                  acid-starved human fibroblasts. Our functional maps
                  can be explored using HEFalMp (Human
                  Experimental/Functional Mapper), a web interface
                  allowing interactive visualization and investigation

                  involves unique psychological risks. The most likely

                  ('bad trip'), which could lead to potentially
                  dangerous behaviour such as leaving the study
                  site. Less common are prolonged psychoses triggered
                  by hallucinogens. Safeguards against these risks
                  include the exclusion of volunteers with personal or
                  family history of psychotic disorders or other
                  severe psychiatric disorders, establishing trust and
                  rapport between session monitors and volunteer
                  before the session, careful volunteer preparation, a
                  safe physical session environment and interpersonal
                  support from at least two study monitors during the
                  session. Investigators should probe for the
                  relatively rare hallucinogen persisting perception
                  disorder in follow-up contact. Persisting adverse
                  reactions are rare when research is conducted along
                  these guidelines. Incautious research may jeopardize
                  participant safety and future research. However,
                  carefully conducted research may inform the
                  treatment of psychiatric disorders, and may lead to
                  advances in basic science. },

                  acquire multiple mutations in order to become a
                  malignant tumor cell. Considerable effort has been
                  invested in finding single genes involved in tumor
                  initiation and progression, but relatively little is
                  known about the constellations of cancer genes that
                  effectively collaborate in oncogenesis. In this
                  study we focus on the identification of co-occurring
                  DNA copy number alterations (i.e., gains and losses
                  of pieces of DNA) in a series of tumor samples. We
                  describe an analysis method to identify DNA copy
                  number mutations that specifically occur together by
                  examining every possible pair of positions on the
                  genome. We analyze a dataset of hematopoietic tumor
                  cell lines, in which we define a network of specific
                  DNA copy number mutations. The regions in this
                  network contain several well-studied cancer related
                  genes. Upon further investigation we find that the
                  regions of DNA copy number alteration also contain
                  large networks of functionally related genes that
                  have not previously been linked to cancer
                  formation. This might illuminate a novel role for
                  these recurrent DNA copy number mutations in
                  hematopoietic malignancies.> },

  abstract =	 {Comparative genomics and systems biology offer
                  unprecedented opportunities for testing central
                  tenets of evolutionary biology formulated by Darwin
                  in the Origin of Species in 1859 and expanded in the
                  Modern Synthesis 100 years
                  later. Evolutionary-genomic studies show that
                  natural selection is only one of the forces that
                  shape genome evolution and is not quantitatively
                  dominant, whereas non-adaptive processes are much
                  more prominent than previously suspected. Major
                  contributions of horizontal gene transfer and
                  diverse selfish genetic elements to genome evolution
                  undermine the Tree of Life concept. An adequate
                  depiction of evolution requires the more complex
                  concept of a network or forest' of life. There is no
                  consistent tendency of evolution towards increased
                  genomic complexity, and when complexity increases,
                  this appears to be a non-adaptive consequence of
                  evolution under weak purifying selection rather than
                  an adaptation. Several universals of genome
                  evolution were discovered including the invariant
                  distributions of evolutionary rates among
                  orthologous genes from diverse genomes and of
                  paralogous gene family sizes, and the negative
                  correlation between gene expression level and
                  sequence evolution rate. Simple, non-adaptive models
                  of evolution explain some of these universals,
                  suggesting that a new synthesis of evolutionary
                  biology might become feasible in a not so remote
                  future.},

                  Arrays (HDONA) simultaneously measure expression of
                  thousands of genes using millions of probes.  We use
                  correlations between measurements for the same gene
                  across 6685 human tissue samples from NCBI's GEO
                  database to indicated the quality of individual
                  HG-U133A probes.  Low correlation indicates a poor
                  probe.RESULTS:Regular expressions can be
                  automatically created from a Backus-Naur form (BNF)
                  context-free grammar using strongly typed genetic
                  programming.CONCLUSIONS:The automatically produced
                  motif is better at predicting poor DNA sequences
                  than an existing human generated RE, suggesting runs

                  crucial role in hybridization techniques including
                  PCR, DNA microarray and RNA interference. Once the
                  entire genome becomes the search space for target
                  genes/genomic sequences, however,
                  cross-hybridization to non-target sequences becomes
                  a problem. Large gene families with significant
                  similarity among family members, such as the P450s,
                  are particularly problematic. Additionally, accurate
                  single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection
                  depends on probes that can distinguish between
                  nearly identical sequences. Conventional
                  oligonucleotide probes that are perfectly matched to
                  target genes/genomic sequences are often unsuitable
                  in such cases. Carefully designed mismatches can be
                  used to decrease cross-hybridization potential, but
                  implementing all possible mismatch probes is
                  impractical. Our study provides guidelines for
                  designing non-perfectly matched DNA probes to target
                  DNA sequences as desired throughout the
                  genome. These guidelines are based on the analysis
                  of hybridization data between perfectly matched and
                  non-perfectly matched DNA sequences (single-point or
                  double-point mutated) calculated in silico. Large
                  changes in hybridization temperature predicted by
                  these guidelines for non-matched oligonucleotides
                  fit independent experimental data very
                  well. Applying the guidelines to find
                  oligonucleotide microarray probes for P450 genes, we
                  confirmed the ability of our point mutation method
                  to differentiate the individual genes in terms of
                  thermodynamic calculations of hybridization and
                  sequence similarity. },

                  gene expression (GE) changes provide valuable
                  information for studying chromosomal instability and
                  its consequences in cancer. While it is clear that
                  the structural aberrations and the transcript levels
                  are intertwined, their relationship is more complex
                  and subtle than initially suspected. Most studies so
                  far have focused on how a CNA affects the expression
                  levels of those genes contained within that CNA.
                  Results: To better understand the impact of CNAs on
                  expression, we investigated the correlation of each
                  CNA to all other genes in the genome. The
                  correlations are computed over multiple patients
                  that have both expression and copy number
                  measurements in brain, bladder and breast cancer
                  data sets. We find that a CNA has a direct impact on
                  the gene amplified or deleted, but it also has a
                  broad, indirect impact elsewhere. To identify a set
                  of CNAs that is coordinately associated with the
                  expression changes of a set of genes, we used a
                  biclustering algorithm on the correlation
                  matrix. For each of the three cancer types examined,
                  the aberrations in several loci are associated with
                  cancer-type specific biological pathways that have
                  been described in the literature: CNAs of chromosome
                  (chr) 7p13 were significantly correlated with
                  epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway
                  in glioblastoma multiforme, chr 13q with NF-kappaB
                  cascades in bladder cancer, and chr 11p with Reck
                  pathway in breast cancer. In all three data sets,
                  gene sets related to cell cycle/division such as M
                  phase, DNA replication and cell division were also
                  associated with CNAs. Our results suggest that CNAs
                  are both directly and indirectly correlated with
                  changes in expression and that it is beneficial to
                  examine the indirect effects of CNAs.  Availability:

  abstract =	 {The advent of microarray technology has drawn
                  immense interest to identify gene expression levels
                  that can serve as biomarkers for disease. Marker
                  genes are selected by examining each individual gene
                  to see how well its expression level discriminates
                  different disease types. In complex diseases such as
                  cancer, good marker genes can be hard to find due to
                  cellular heterogeneity within the tissue and genetic
                  heterogeneity across patients. A promising technique
                  for addressing these challenges is to incorporate
                  biological pathway information into the marker
                  identification procedure, permitting disease
                  classification based on the activity of entire
                  pathways rather than simply on the expression levels
                  of individual genes. However, previous pathway-based
                  methods have not significantly outperformed
                  gene-based methods. Here, we propose a new
                  pathway-based classification procedure in which
                  markers are encoded not as individual genes, nor as
                  the set of genes making up a known pathway, but as
                  subsets of 'condition-responsive genes (CORGs)'
                  within those pathways. Using expression profiles
                  from seven different microarray studies, we show
                  that the accuracy of this method is significantly
                  better than both the conventional gene- and pathway-
                  based diagnostics. Furthermore, the identified CORGs
                  may facilitate the development of effective
                  diagnostic markers and the discovery of molecular
                  mechanisms underlying disease.},

                  a gene interaction network that reflects the
                  intracellular communication pathways that adjust
                  cellular metabolic activity and cell division to the
                  limiting nutrient conditions that trigger metabolic
                  oscillations. The success of the present approach in
                  extracting meaningful genetic connections suggests
                  that the maximum entropy principle is a useful
                  concept for understanding living systems, as it is
                  for other complex, nonequilibrium systems. },

  abstract =	 {Motivation: Unraveling the transcriptional
                  regulatory program mediated by transcription factors
                  (TFs) is a fundamental objective of computational
                  biology, yet still remains a challenge. Method:
                  Here, we present a new methodology that integrates
                  microarray and TF binding data for unraveling
                  transcriptional regulatory networks. The algorithm
                  is based on a two-stage constrained matrix
                  decomposition model. The model takes into account
                  the non-linear structure in gene expression data,
                  particularly in the TF-target gene interactions and
                  the combinatorial nature of gene regulation by
                  TFs. The gene expression profile is modeled as a
                  linear weighted combination of the activity profiles
                  of a set of TFs. The TF activity profiles are
                  deduced from the expression levels of TF target
                  genes, instead directly from TFs themselves. The
                  TF-target gene relationships are derived from
                  ChIP-chip and other TF binding data. The proposed
                  algorithm can not only identify transcriptional
                  modules, but also reveal regulatory programs of
                  which TFs control which target genes in which
                  specific ways (either activating or
                  inhibiting). Results: In comparison with other
                  methods, our algorithm identifies biologically more
                  meaningful transcriptional modules relating to
                  specific TFs. We applied the new algorithm on yeast
                  cell cycle and stress response data. While known
                  transcriptional regulations were confirmed, novel
                  TF-gene interactions were predicted and provide new
                  insights into the regulatory mechanisms of the
                  cell. Contact: zhanmi@mail.nih.gov Supplementary

  abstract =	 {Motivation: Graphs or networks are common ways of
                  depicting information. In biology in particular,
                  many different biological processes are represented
                  by graphs, such as regulatory networks or metabolic
                  pathways. This kind of a priori information gathered
                  over many years of biomedical research is a useful
                  supplement to the standard numerical genomic data
                  such as microarray gene-expression data. How to
                  incorporate information encoded by the known
                  biological networks or graphs into analysis of
                  numerical data raises interesting statistical
                  challenges. In this article, we introduce a
                  network-constrained regularization procedure for
                  linear regression analysis in order to incorporate
                  the information from these graphs into an analysis
                  of the numerical data, where the network is
                  represented as a graph and its corresponding
                  Laplacian matrix. We define a network-constrained
                  penalty function that penalizes the L1-norm of the
                  coefficients but encourages smoothness of the
                  coefficients on the network. Results: Simulation
                  studies indicated that the method is quite effective
                  in identifying genes and subnetworks that are
                  related to disease and has higher sensitivity than
                  the commonly used procedures that do not use the
                  pathway structure information. Application to one
                  glioblastoma microarray gene-expression dataset
                  identified several subnetworks on several of the
                  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
                  transcriptional pathways that are related to
                  survival from glioblastoma, many of which were
                  supported by published literatures. Conclusions: The
                  proposed network-constrained regularization
                  procedure efficiently utilizes the known pathway
                  structures in identifying the relevant genes and the
                  subnetworks that might be related to phenotype in a
                  general regression framework. As more biological
                  networks are identified and documented in databases,
                  the proposed method should find more applications in
                  identifying the subnetworks that are related to
                  diseases and other biological processes. Contact:

  abstract =	 {Motivation: Given the complex nature of biological
                  systems, pathways often need to function in a
                  coordinated fashion in order to produce appropriate
                  physiological responses to both internal and
                  external stimuli. Therefore, understanding the
                  interaction and crosstalk between pathways is
                  important for understanding the function of both
                  cells and more complex systems.  Results: We have
                  developed a computational approach to detect
                  crosstalk among pathways based on protein
                  interactions between the pathway components. We
                  built a global mammalian pathway crosstalk network
                  that includes 580 pathways (covering 4753 genes)
                  with 1815 edges between pathways. This crosstalk
                  network follows a power-law distribution: P(k) [~]
                  k-{gamma}, {gamma} = 1.45, where P(k) is the number
                  of pathways with k neighbors, thus pathway
                  interactions may exhibit the same scale-free
                  phenomenon that has been documented for protein
                  interaction networks. We further used this network
                  to understand colorectal cancer progression to
                  metastasis based on transcriptomic data.  Contact:

                  outcome analysis with array comparative genomic
                  hybridization and mRNA expression profiling was
                  developed to identify genes with copy number
                  alterations, aberrant mRNA expression, and relevance
                  to survival in glioblastoma. The method led to the
                  discovery of physical gene clusters within the
                  cancer genome with boundaries defined by physical
                  proximity, correlated mRNA expression patterns, and
                  survival relatedness. These boundaries delineate a
                  novel genomic interval called the functional common
                  region (FCR). Many FCRs contained genes of high
                  biological relevance to cancer and were used to
                  pinpoint functionally significant DNA alterations
                  that were too small or infrequent to be reliably
                  identified using standard algorithms. One such FCR
                  contained the EphA2 receptor tyrosine
                  kinase. Validation experiments showed that EphA2
                  mRNA overexpression correlated inversely with
                  patient survival in a panel of 21 glioblastomas, and
                  ligand-mediated EphA2 receptor activation increased
                  glioblastoma proliferation and tumor growth via a
                  mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent
                  pathway. This novel genome-wide approach greatly
                  expanded the list of target genes in glioblastoma
                  and represents a powerful new strategy to identify
                  the upstream determinants of tumor phenotype in a
                  range of human cancers. (Cancer Res 2006; 66(22):

                  sequences provides a tool for the identification of
                  functional elements in genomes. We have created a
                  database of evolutionary conserved regions (ECRs) in
                  vertebrate genomes, entitled ECRbase, which is
                  constructed from a collection of whole-genome
                  alignments produced by the ECR Browser. ECRbase
                  features a database of syntenic blocks that
                  recapitulate the evolution of rearrangements in
                  vertebrates and a comprehensive collection of
                  promoters in all vertebrate genomes generated using
                  multiple sources of gene annotation. The database
                  also contains a collection of annotated
                  transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in
                  evolutionary conserved and promoter
                  elements. ECRbase currently includes human, rhesus
                  macaque, dog, opossum, rat, mouse, chicken, frog,

                  operation, there are circumstances in which we
                  believe (with varying degrees of certainty) that
                  items A and B should be assigned to the same cluster
                  , while items A and C should not. We would like such
                  pairwise relations to influence cluster assignmen ts
                  of out-of-sample data in a manner consistent with
                  the prior knowledge expressed in the training set
                  . Our starting point is probabilistic clustering
                  based on gaussian mixture models (GMM) of the data
                  di stribution. We express clustering preferences in
                  a prior distribution over assignments of data points
                  to clusters. This prior penalizes cluster
                  assignments according to the degree with which they
                  violate the preferences. The model parameters are
                  fit with the expectation-maximization (EM)
                  algorithm. Our mo del provides a flexible framework
                  that encompasses several other semisupervised
                  clustering models as i ts special cases. Experiments
                  on artificial and real-world problems show that our

                  when pairwise relations are incorporated. The

                  handling noisy pairwise relations. },

  ABSTRACT =	 {BACKGROUND:Probability based statistical learning
                  methods such as mutual information and Bayesian
                  networks have emerged as a major category of tools
                  for reverse engineering mechanistic relationships
                  from quantitative biological data. In this work we
                  introduce a new statistical learning strategy, MI3
                  that addresses three common issues in previous
                  methods simultaneously: (1) handling of continuous
                  variables, (2) detection of more complex three-way
                  relationships and (3) better differentiation of
                  causal versus confounding relationships. With these
                  improvements, we provide a more realistic
                  representation of the underlying biological
                  system.RESULTS:We test the MI3 algorithm using both
                  synthetic and experimental data. In the synthetic
                  data experiment, MI3 achieved an absolute
                  sensitivity/precision of 0.77/0.83 and a relative
                  sensitivity/precision both of 0.99. In addition, MI3
                  significantly outperformed the control methods,
                  including Bayesian networks, classical two-way
                  mutual information and a discrete version of MI3. We
                  then used MI3 and control methods to infer a
                  regulatory network centered at the MYC transcription
                  factor from a published microarray dataset. Models
                  selected by MI3 were numerically and biologically
                  distinct from those selected by control
                  methods. Unlike control methods, MI3 effectively
                  differentiated true causal models from confounding
                  models. MI3 recovered major MYC cofactors, and
                  revealed major mechanisms involved in MYC dependent
                  transcriptional regulation, which are strongly
                  supported by literature. The MI3 network showed that
                  limited sets of regulatory mechanisms are employed
                  repeatedly to control the expression of large number
                  of genes.CONCLUSION:Overall, our work demonstrates
                  that MI3 outperforms the frequently used control
                  methods, and provides a powerful method for
                  inferring mechanistic relationships underlying
                  biological and other complex systems. The MI3 method
                  is implemented in R in the "mi3" package, available
                  under the GNU GPL from
                  http://sysbio.engin.umich.edu/~luow/downloads.php
                  and from the R package archive CRAN.}

  ABSTRACT =	 {BACKGROUND:The versatility of DNA copy number
                  amplifications for profiling and categorization of
                  various tissue samples has been widely acknowledged
                  in the biomedical literature. For instance, this
                  type of measurement techniques provides
                  possibilities for exploring sets of cancerous
                  tissues to identify novel subtypes. The previously
                  utilized statistical approaches to various kinds of
                  analyses include traditional algorithmic techniques
                  for clustering and dimension reduction, such as
                  independent and principal component analyses,
                  hierarchical clustering, as well as model-based
                  clustering usingmaximum likelihood estimation for
                  latent class models.  RESULTS:While purely
                  algorithmic methods are usually easily applicable,
                  their suboptimal performance and limitations in
                  making formal inference have been thoroughly
                  discussed in the statistical literature. Here we
                  introduce a Bayesian model-based approach to
                  simultaneous identification of underlying tissue
                  groups and the informative amplifications. The
                  model-based approach provides the possibility of
                  using formal inference to determine the number of
                  groups from the data, in contrast to the ad hoc
                  methods often exploited for similar purposes. The
                  model also automatically recognizes the chromosomal
                  areas that are relevant for the
                  clustering.CONCLUSIONS:Validatory analyses of
                  simulated data and a large database of DNA copy
                  number amplifications in human neoplasms are used to
                  illustrate the potential of our approach. Our
                  software implementation BASTA for performing
                  Bayesian statistical tissue profiling is freely
                  available for academic purposes at

                  predict gene function through the ?guilt by
                  association? principle: coexpressed genes are likely
                  to be functionally associated. Methodology/Principal
                  Findings: We analyzed publicly available expression
                  data on normal human tissues. The analysis is based
                  on the integration of data obtained with two
                  experimental platforms (microarrays and SAGE) and of
                  various measures of dissimilarity between expression
                  profiles. The building blocks of the procedure are
                  the Ranked Coexpression Groups (RCG), small sets of
                  tightly coexpressed genes which are analyzed in
                  terms of functional annotation. Functionally
                  characterized RCGs are selected by means of the
                  majority rule and used to predict new functional
                  annotations. Functionally characterized RCGs are
                  enriched in groups of genes associated to similar
                  phenotypes. We exploit this fact to find new
                  candidate disease genes for many OMIM phenotypes of
                  unknown molecular origin. Conclusions/Significance:
                  We predict new functional annotations for many human
                  genes, showing that the integration of different
                  data sets and coexpression measures significantly
                  improves the scope of the results. Combining gene
                  expression data, functional annotation and known
                  phenotype-gene associations we provide candidate
                  genes for several genetic diseases of unknown
                  molecular basis. },

  ABSTRACT =	 {BACKGROUND:Functional profiling methods have been
                  extensively used in the context of high-throughput
                  experiments and, in particular, in microarray data
                  analysis. Such methods use available biological
                  information to define different types of functional
                  gene modules (e.g. gene ontology -GO-, KEGG
                  pathways, etc.) whose representation in a
                  pre-defined list of genes is further studied. In the
                  most popular type of microarray experimental designs
                  (e.g. up- or down-regulated genes, clusters of
                  co-expressing genes, etc.) or in other genomic
                  experiments (e.g. Chip-on-chip, epigenomics, etc.)
                  these lists are composed by genes with a high degree
                  of co-expression. Therefore, an implicit assumption
                  in the application of functional profiling methods
                  within this context is that the genes corresponding
                  to the modules tested are effectively defining sets
                  of co-expressing genes. Nevertheless not all the
                  functional modules are biologically coherent
                  entities in terms of co-expression, which will
                  eventually hinder its detection with conventional
                  methods of functional enrichment.RESULTS:Using a
                  large collection of microarray data we have carried
                  out a detailed survey of internal correlation in GO
                  terms and KEGG pathways, providing a coherence index
                  to be used for measuring functional module
                  co-regulation. An unexpected low level of internal
                  correlation was found among the modules
                  studied. Only around 30\% of the modules defined by
                  GO terms and 57\% of the modules defined by KEGG
                  pathways display an internal correlation higher than
                  the expected by chance.This information on the
                  internal correlation of the genes within the
                  functional modules can be used in the context of a
                  logistic regression model in a simple way to improve
                  their detection in gene expression
                  experiments.CONCLUSION:For the first time, an
                  exhaustive study on the internal co-expression of
                  the most popular functional categories has been
                  carried out. Interestingly, the real level of
                  coexpression within many of them is lower than
                  expected (or even inexistent), which will preclude
                  its detection by means of most conventional
                  functional profiling methods. If the
                  gene-to-function correlation information is used in
                  functional profiling methods, the results obtained
                  improve the ones obtained by conventional enrichment
                  methods.}

  abstract =	 {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as important, albeit
                  poorly characterized, regulators of biological
                  processes. Key to further elucidation of their roles
                  is the generation of more complete lists of their
                  numbers and expression changes in different cell
                  states. Here, we report a new method for surveying
                  the expression of small RNAs, including microRNAs,
                  using Illumina sequencing technology. We also
                  present a set of methods for annotating sequences
                  deriving from known miRNAs, identifying variability
                  in mature miRNA sequences, and identifying sequences
                  belonging to previously unidentified miRNA
                  genes. Application of this approach to RNA from
                  human embryonic stem cells obtained before and after
                  their differentiation into embryoid bodies revealed
                  the sequences and expression levels of 334 known
                  plus 104 novel miRNA genes. One hundred seventy-one
                  known and 23 novel microRNA sequences exhibited
                  significant expression differences between these two
                  developmental states. Owing to the increased number
                  of sequence reads, these libraries represent the
                  deepest miRNA sampling to date, spanning nearly six
                  orders of magnitude of expression. The predicted
                  targets of those miRNAs enriched in either sample
                  shared common features. Included among the
                  high-ranked predicted gene targets are those
                  implicated in differentiation, cell cycle control,
                  programmed cell death, and transcriptional

  abstract =	 {Motivation: The clustering of gene profiles across
                  some experimental conditions of interest contributes
                  significantly to the elucidation of unknown gene
                  function, the validation of gene discoveries and the
                  interpretation of biological processes. However,
                  this clustering problem is not straightforward as
                  the profiles of the genes are not all independently
                  distributed and the expression levels may have been
                  obtained from an experimental design involving
                  replicated arrays. Ignoring the dependence between
                  the gene profiles and the structure of the
                  replicated data can result in important sources of
                  variability in the experiments being overlooked in
                  the analysis, with the consequent possibility of
                  misleading inferences being made. We propose a
                  random-effects model that provides a unified
                  approach to the clustering of genes with correlated
                  expression levels measured in a wide variety of
                  experimental situations. Our model is an extension
                  of the normal mixture model to account for the
                  correlations between the gene profiles and to enable
                  covariate information to be incorporated into the
                  clustering process. Hence the model is applicable to
                  longitudinal studies with or without replication,
                  for example, time-course experiments by using time
                  as a covariate, and to cross-sectional experiments
                  by using categorical covariates to represent the
                  different experimental classes. Results: We show
                  that our random-effects model can be fitted by
                  maximum likelihood via the EM algorithm for which
                  the E(expectation)and M(maximization) steps can be
                  implemented in closed form. Hence our model can be
                  fitted deterministically without the need for
                  time-consuming Monte Carlo approximations. The
                  effectiveness of our model-based procedure for the
                  clustering of correlated gene profiles is
                  demonstrated on three real datasets, representing
                  typical microarray experimental designs, covering
                  time-course, repeated-measurement and
                  cross-sectional data. In these examples, relevant
                  clusters of the genes are obtained, which are
                  supported by existing gene-function annotation. A
                  synthetic dataset is considered too. Availability: A

                  priors in order to automatically infer the model
                  order. The algorithms are tested on synthetic data
                  and used for analyzing amino acids and fMRI data. In
                  a model selection task the variational lower bound
                  on the marginal likelihood inferred, in a reliable
                  manner, the correct model type. On the other hand,

  ABSTRACT =	 {BACKGROUND:Most analyses of microarray data are
                  based on point estimates of expression levels and
                  ignore the uncertainty of such estimates. By
                  determining uncertainties from Affymetrix GeneChip
                  data and propagating these uncertainties to
                  downstream analyses it has been shown that we can
                  improve results of differential expression
                  detection, principal component analysis and
                  clustering. Previously, implementations of these
                  uncertainty propagation methods have only been
                  available as separate packages, written in different
                  languages. Previous implementations have also
                  suffered from being very costly to compute, and in
                  the case of differential expression detection, have
                  been limited in the experimental designs to which
                  they can be applied.RESULTS:puma is a Bioconductor
                  package incorporating a suite of analysis methods
                  for use on Affymetrix GeneChip data. puma extends
                  the differential expression detection methods of
                  previous work from the 2-class case to the
                  multi-factorial case. puma can be used to
                  automatically create design and contrast matrices
                  for typical experimental designs, which can be used
                  both within the package itself but also in other
                  Bioconductor packages. The implementation of
                  differential expression detection methods has been
                  parallelised leading to significant decreases in
                  processing time on a range of computer
                  architectures. puma incorporates the first R
                  implementation of an uncertainty propagation version
                  of principal component analysis, and an
                  implementation of a clustering method based on
                  uncertainty propagation. All of these techniques are
                  brought together in a single, easy-to-use package
                  with clear, task-based documentation.CONCLUSION:For
                  the first time, the puma package makes a suite of
                  uncertainty propagation methods available to a
                  general audience. These methods can be used to
                  improve results from more traditional analyses of
                  microarray data. puma also offers improvements in
                  terms of scope and speed of execution over
                  previously available methods. puma is recommended
                  for anyone working with the Affymetrix GeneChip
                  platform for gene expression analysis and can also
                  be applied more generally.},

  abstract =	 {The search for feature enrichment is a widely used
                  method to characterize a set of genes. While several
                  tools have been designed for nominal features such
                  as Gene Ontology annotations or KEGG Pathways, very
                  little has been proposed to tackle numerical
                  features such as the chromosomal positions of
                  genes. For instance, microarray studies typically
                  generate gene lists that are differentially
                  expressed in the sample subgroups under
                  investigation, and when studying diseases caused by
                  genome alterations, it is of great interest to
                  delineate the chromosomal regions that are
                  significantly enriched in these lists. In this
                  article, we present a positional gene enrichment
                  analysis method (PGE) for the identification of
                  chromosomal regions that are significantly enriched
                  in a given set of genes. The strength of our method
                  relies on an original query optimization approach
                  that allows to virtually consider all the possible
                  chromosomal regions for enrichment, and on the
                  multiple testing correction which discriminates
                  truly enriched regions versus those that can occur
                  by chance. We have developed a Web tool implementing
                  this method applied to the human genome
                  (http://www.esat.kuleuven.be/~bioiuser/pge). We
                  validated PGE on published lists of differentially
                  expressed genes. These analyses showed significant
                  overrepresentation of known aberrant chromosomal
                  regions.},

  abstract =	 {Motivation: Protein complexes integrate multiple
                  gene products to coordinate many biological
                  functions. Given a graph representing pairwise
                  protein interaction data one can search for
                  subgraphs representing protein complexes. Previous
                  methods for performing such search relied on the
                  assumption that complexes form a clique in that
                  graph. While this assumption is true for some
                  complexes, it does not hold for many others. New
                  algorithms are required in order to recover
                  complexes with other types of topological
                  structure. Results: We present an algorithm for
                  inferring protein complexes from weighted
                  interaction graphs. By using graph topological
                  patterns and biological properties as features, we
                  model each complex subgraph by a probabilistic
                  Bayesian network (BN). We use a training set of
                  known complexes to learn the parameters of this BN
                  model. The log-likelihood ratio derived from the BN
                  is then used to score subgraphs in the protein
                  interaction graph and identify new complexes. We
                  applied our method to protein interaction data in
                  yeast. As we show our algorithm achieved a
                  considerable improvement over clique based
                  algorithms in terms of its ability to recover known
                  complexes. We discuss some of the new complexes
                  predicted by our algorithm and determine that they
                  likely represent true complexes. Availability:

                  Illumina-based metagenomic sequencing, assembly and
                  characterization of 3.3 million non-redundant
                  microbial genes, derived from 576.7 gigabases of
                  sequence, from faecal samples of 124 European
                  individuals. The gene set, approximately 150 times
                  larger than the human gene complement, contains an
                  overwhelming majority of the prevalent (more
                  frequent) microbial genes of the cohort and probably
                  includes a large proportion of the prevalent human
                  intestinal microbial genes. The genes are largely
                  shared among individuals of the cohort. Over 99\% of
                  the genes are bacterial, indicating that the entire

                  bacterial species and each individual at least 160

  abstract =	 {microRNAs are small RNA molecules that regulate gene
                  expression by controlling the output of proteins and
                  other RNAs. The exact mechanism through which a
                  microRNA binds to its target and how this affects
                  the target is still a subject of much debate. In
                  this article, the authors sought to find a reverse
                  approach to discover the impact of microRNAs on gene
                  expression. Instead of searching for specific
                  targets of a given microRNA, they searched for
                  microRNA signatures: changes in the levels of
                  microRNAs across multiple tissues that impacted
                  significantly the levels of messenger gene
                  expression in these same tissues. Because many core
                  biological functions are conserved between human and
                  mouse, the authors compared these microRNA
                  signatures between these two species. They found
                  that identical microRNA signatures between these
                  organisms could effectively predict microRNA targets
                  and could estimate the global impact of individual
                  microRNAs on gene output. They further demonstrated
                  that many microRNAs act as expression enhancers by
                  inhibiting gene repressors.},

                  activity of miRNAs. Our findings suggest that the
                  indirect enhancement of gene expression by miRNAs

@article{Russ10,
  abstract =	 {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Human tissue displays a
                  remarkable diversity in structure and function. To
                  understand how such diversity emerges from the same
                  DNA, systematic measurements of gene expression
                  across different tissues in the human body are
                  essential. Several recent studies addressed this
                  formidable task using microarray technologies. These
                  large tissue expression data sets have provided us
                  an important basis for biomedical research. However,
                  it is well known that microarray data can be
                  compromised by high noise level and various
                  experimental artefacts. Critical comparison of
                  different data sets can help to reveal such errors
                  and to avoid pitfalls in their application. RESULTS:
                  We present here the first comparison and integration
                  of four freely available tissue expression data sets
                  generated using three different microarray platforms
                  and containing a total of 377 microarray
                  hybridizations. When assessing the tissue expression
                  of genes, we found that the results considerably
                  depend on the chosen data set. Nevertheless, the
                  comparison also revealed statistically significant
                  similarity of gene expression profiles across
                  different platforms. This enabled us to construct
                  consolidated lists of platform-independent
                  tissue-specific genes using a set of complementary
                  measures. Follow-up analyses showed that results
                  based on consolidated data tend to be more
                  reliable. CONCLUSIONS: Our study strongly indicates
                  that the consolidation of four different tissue
                  expression data sets can increase the data quality
                  and can lead to biologically more meaningful
                  results. The provided compendium of
                  platform-independent gene lists should facilitate
                  the identification of novel tissue-specific marker
                  genes.},

  abstract =	 {We present a method termed mining developmentally
                  regulated genes (MiDReG) to predict genes whose
                  expression is either activated or repressed as
                  precursor cells differentiate. MiDReG does not
                  require gene expression data from intermediate
                  stages of development. MiDReG is based on the gene
                  expression patterns between the initial and terminal
                  stages of the differentiation pathway, coupled with
                  if-then rules (Boolean implications) mined from
                  large-scale microarray databases. MiDReG uses two
                  gene expression-based seed conditions that mark the
                  initial and the terminal stages of a given
                  differentiation pathway and combines the
                  statistically inferred Boolean implications from
                  these seed conditions to identify the relevant
                  genes. The method was validated by applying it to
                  B-cell development. The algorithm predicted 62 genes
                  that are expressed after the KIT+ progenitor cell
                  stage and remain expressed through CD19+ and AICDA+
                  germinal center B cells. qRT-PCR of 14 of these
                  genes on sorted B-cell progenitors confirmed that
                  the expression of 10 genes is indeed stably
                  established during B-cell differentiation. Review of
                  the published literature of knockout mice revealed
                  that of the predicted genes, 63.4 percent have
                  defects in B-cell differentiation and function and
                  22 percent have a role in the B cell according to
                  other experiments, and the remaining 14.6 percent
                  are not characterized. Therefore, our method
                  identified novel gene candidates for future
                  examination of their role in B-cell
                  development. These data demonstrate the power of
                  MiDReG in predicting functionally important
                  intermediate genes in a given developmental pathway
                  that is defined by a mutually exclusive gene
                  expression pattern. },

  abstract =	 {Motivation: A fundamental task in systems biology is
                  the identification of groups of genes that are
                  involved in the cellular response to particular
                  signals. At its simplest level, this often reduces
                  to identifying biological quantities (mRNA
                  abundance, enzyme concentrations, etc.) which are
                  differentially expressed in two different
                  conditions. Popular approaches involve using t-test
                  statistics, based on modelling the data as arising
                  from a mixture distribution. A common assumption of
                  these approaches is that the data are independent
                  and identically distributed; however, biological
                  quantities are usually related through a complex
                  (weighted) network of interactions, and often the
                  more pertinent question is which subnetworks are
                  differentially expressed, rather than which
                  genes. Furthermore, in many interesting cases (such
                  as high-throughput proteomics and metabolomics),
                  only very partial observations are available,
                  resulting in the need for efficient imputation
                  techniques. Results: We introduce Mixture Model on
                  Graphs (MMG), a novel probabilistic model to
                  identify differentially expressed submodules of
                  biological networks and pathways. The method can
                  easily incorporate information about weights in the
                  network, is robust against missing data and can be
                  easily generalized to directed networks. We propose
                  an efficient sampling strategy to infer posterior
                  probabilities of differential expression, as well as
                  posterior probabilities over the model
                  parameters. We assess our method on artificial data
                  demonstrating significant improvements over standard
                  mixture model clustering. Analysis of our model
                  results on quantitative high-throughput proteomic
                  data leads to the identification of biologically
                  significant subnetworks, as well as the prediction
                  of the expression level of a number of enzymes, some
                  of which are then verified
                  experimentally. Availability: MATLAB code is

  ABSTRACT =	 {BACKGROUND:Gene expression microarray and other
                  multiplex data hold promise for addressing the
                  challenges of cellular complexity, refined diagnoses
                  and the discovery of well-targeted treatments. A new
                  approach to the construction and quantification of
                  transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) is
                  presented that integrates gene expression microarray
                  data and cell modeling through information
                  theory. Given a partial TRN and time series data, a
                  probability density is constructed that is a
                  functional of the time course of transcription
                  factor (TF) thermodynamic activities at the site of
                  gene control, and is a function of mRNA degradation
                  and transcription rate coefficients, and equilibrium
                  constants for TF/gene binding.RESULTS:Our approach
                  yields more physicochemical information that
                  compliments the results of network structure
                  delineation methods, and thereby can serve as an
                  element of a comprehensive TRN
                  discovery/quantification system. The most probable
                  TF time courses and values of the aforementioned
                  parameters are obtained by maximizing the
                  probability obtained through entropy
                  maximization. Observed time delays between mRNA
                  expression and activity are accounted for implicitly
                  since the time course of the activity of a TF is
                  coupled by probability functional maximization, and
                  is not assumed to be proportional to expression
                  level of the mRNA type that translates into the
                  TF. This allows one to investigate
                  post-translational and TF activation mechanisms of
                  gene regulation. Accuracy and robustness of the
                  method are evaluated. A kinetic formulation is used
                  to facilitate the analysis of phenomena with a
                  strongly dynamical character while a
                  physically-motivated regularization of the TF time
                  course is found to overcome difficulties due to
                  omnipresent noise and data sparsity that plague
                  other methods of gene expression data analysis. An
                  application to Escherichia coli is
                  presented.CONCLUSION:Multiplex time series data can
                  be used for the construction of the network of
                  cellular processes and the calibration of the
                  associated physicochemical parameters. We have
                  demonstrated these concepts in the context of gene
                  regulation understood through the analysis of gene
                  expression microarray time series data. Casting the
                  approach in a probabilistic framework has allowed us
                  to address the uncertainties in gene expression
                  microarray data. Our approach was found to be robust
                  to error in the gene expression microarray data and
                  mistakes in a proposed TRN.},

                  genetic features like copy number (CN) variation,
                  gene expression (GE) or loss of heterocygosity has
                  considerably increased in recent years, as well as
                  the number of available datasets. This is
                  particularly due to the success of microarray
                  technology. Thus, to understand mechanisms of
                  disease pathogenesis on a molecular basis, e.g. in
                  cancer research, the challenge of analyzing such
                  different data types in an integrated way has become
                  increasingly important. In order to tackle this
                  problem, we propose a new procedure for an
                  integrated analysis of two different data types that
                  searches for genes and genetic regions which for
                  both inputs display strong equally directed
                  deviations from the reference median. We employ this
                  approach, based on a modified correlation
                  coefficient and an explorative Wilcoxon test, to
                  find DNA regions of such abnormalities in GE and CN
                  (e.g. underexpressed genes accompanied by a loss of
                  DNA material).  Results: In an application to acute
                  myeloid leukemia, our procedure is able to identify
                  various regions on different chromosomes with
                  characteristic abnormalities in GE and CN data and
                  shows a higher sensitivity to differences in
                  abnormalities than standard approaches. While the
                  results support various findings of previous

@article{Schmid05,
  abstract =	 {Regulatory regions of plant genes tend to be more
                  compact than those of animal genes, but the
                  complement of transcription factors encoded in plant
                  genomes is as large or larger than that found in
                  those of animals. Plants therefore provide an
                  opportunity to study how transcriptional programs
                  control multicellular development. We analyzed
                  global gene expression during development of the
                  reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana in samples
                  covering many stages, from embryogenesis to
                  senescence, and diverse organs. Here, we provide a
                  first analysis of this data set, which is part of
                  the AtGenExpress expression atlas. We observed that
                  the expression levels of transcription factor genes
                  and signal transduction components are similar to
                  those of metabolic genes. Examining the expression
                  patterns of large gene families, we found that they
                  are often more similar than would be expected by
                  chance, indicating that many gene families have been
                  co-opted for specific developmental processes.},

                  increase, but not to a decrease in the expression of
                  its subunits. This means that whereas phenotypes
                  resulting from a decrease in gene expression can be
                  predicted because they cluster on networks of
                  protein complexes, over-expression phenotypes cannot
                  be predicted in this way. We discuss the

                  cells are regulated, how they evolve, and how
                  genetic perturbations connect to disease in humans.}

                  but it is undoubtedly an important cognitive
                  process. This makes it an interesting challenge for
                  modern neuroscientific exploration -- especially
                  given the current interest in developing cognitive
                  enhancers for commercial and clinical uses. There
                  are similarities between the typical traits of
                  creative people and the subjective psychological
                  characteristics of the psychedelic (hallucinogenic)
                  drug experience. This phenomenon was studied in a
                  number of small trials and case studies in the
                  1960s. Results were inconclusive, and the quality of
                  these studies -- by modern research standards -- was
                  merely anecdotal. Nevertheless, with today's current
                  renaissance in psychedelic drug research and the
                  growing interest in cognitive enhancing drugs, now
                  may be the time to re-visit these studies with
                  contemporary research methods. },

                  involving more than 800 independent genes. We
                  present a detailed review of the various structural

                  particular reference to their influence on human

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have used DNA
                  microarrays to survey gene expression in cancer and
                  other disease states. Comparatively little is known
                  about the genes expressed across the gamut of normal
                  human tissues. Systematic studies of global
                  gene-expression patterns, by linking variation in
                  the expression of specific genes to phenotypic
                  variation in the cells or tissues in which they are
                  expressed, provide clues to the molecular
                  organization of diverse cells and to the potential
                  roles of the genes. RESULTS: Here we describe a
                  systematic survey of gene expression in 115 human
                  tissue samples representing 35 different tissue
                  types, using cDNA microarrays representing
                  approximately 26,000 different human
                  genes. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of
                  the gene-expression patterns in these tissues
                  identified clusters of genes with related biological
                  functions and grouped the tissue specimens in a
                  pattern that reflected their anatomic locations,
                  cellular compositions or physiologic functions. In
                  unsupervised and supervised analyses,
                  tissue-specific patterns of gene expression were
                  readily discernable. By comparative hybridization to
                  normal genomic DNA, we were also able to estimate
                  transcript abundances for expressed
                  genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our dataset provides a baseline
                  for comparison to diseased tissues, and will aid in
                  the identification of tissue-specific functions. In
                  addition, our analysis identifies potential
                  molecular markers for detection of injury to
                  specific organs and tissues, and provides a
                  foundation for selection of potential targets for
                  selective anticancer therapy.},

  abstract =	 {Motivation: Datasets resulting from metabolomics or
                  metabolic profiling experiments are becoming
                  increasingly complex. Such datasets may contain
                  underlying factors, such as time (time-resolved or
                  longitudinal measurements), doses or combinations
                  thereof. Currently used biostatistics methods do not
                  take the structure of such complex datasets into
                  account. However, incorporating this structure into
                  the data analysis is important for understanding the
                  biological information in these datasets.  Results:
                  We describe ASCA, a new method that can deal with
                  complex multivariate datasets containing an
                  underlying experimental design, such as metabolomics
                  datasets. It is a direct generalization of analysis
                  of variance (ANOVA) for univariate data to the
                  multivariate case. The method allows for easy
                  interpretation of the variation induced by the
                  different factors of the design. The method is
                  illustrated with a dataset from a metabolomics
                  experiment with time and dose factors.

                  prognostic and predictive signatures with superior
                  performance to conventional histopathological or
                  clinical parameters. Consequently, signatures are
                  being incorporated into clinical practice and will
                  soon influence everyday decisions in
                  oncology. However, the slight overlap in the gene
                  identity between signatures for the same cancer type
                  or condition raises questions about their biological
                  and clinical implications. To clarify these issues,
                  better understanding of the molecular properties and
                  possible interactions underlying apparently
                  dissimilar signatures is needed. Here, we evaluated
                  whether the signatures of 24 independent studies are
                  related at the genome, transcriptome or proteome
                  levels. Significant associations were consistently
                  observed across these molecular layers, which
                  suggest the existence of a common cancer cell
                  phenotype. Convergence on cell proliferation and
                  death supports the pivotal involvement of these
                  processes in prognosis, metastasis and treatment
                  response. In addition, functional and molecular
                  associations were identified with the immune
                  response in different cancer types and conditions
                  that complement the contribution of cell
                  proliferation and death. Examination of additional,
                  independent, cancer datasets corroborated our
                  observations. This study proposes a comprehensive
                  strategy for interpreting cancer signatures that
                  reveals common design principles and systems-level
                  properties.},

  abstract =	 {Genome-wide expression profiling of normal tissue
                  may facilitate our understanding of the etiology of
                  diseased organs and augment the development of new
                  targeted therapeutics. Here, we have developed a
                  high-density gene expression database of 18,927
                  unique genes for 158 normal human samples from 19
                  different organs of 30 different individuals using
                  DNA microarrays. We report four main
                  findings. First, despite very diverse sample
                  parameters (e.g., age, ethnicity, sex, and
                  postmortem interval), the expression profiles
                  belonging to the same organs cluster together,
                  demonstrating internal stability of the
                  database. Second, the gene expression profiles
                  reflect major organ-specific functions on the
                  molecular level, indicating consistency of our
                  database with known biology. Third, we demonstrate
                  that any small (i.e., n approximately 100), randomly
                  selected subset of genes can approximately reproduce
                  the hierarchical clustering of the full data set,
                  suggesting that the observed differential expression
                  of >90\% of the probed genes is of biological
                  origin. Fourth, we demonstrate a potential
                  application of this database to cancer research by
                  identifying 19 tumor-specific genes in
                  neuroblastoma. The selected genes are relatively
                  underexpressed in all of the organs examined and
                  belong to therapeutically relevant pathways, making
                  them potential novel diagnostic markers and targets
                  for therapy. We expect this database will be of
                  utility for developing rationally designed
                  molecularly targeted therapeutics in diseases such
                  as cancer, as well as for exploring the functions of
                  genes.},

                  is that the concentrations of a small but
                  significant number of metabolites are strongly
                  correlated when measurements of biological
                  replicates are performed. This review seeks to
                  summarize the recent efforts to elucidate the origin

                  proteomic counterparts, and a straightforward
                  interpretation in terms of the underlying
                  biochemical pathways will unavoidably fail. It is
                  demonstrated that the comparative correlations

  abstract =	 {With the advent of high-throughput technologies for
                  measuring genome-wide expression profiles, a large
                  number of methods have been proposed for discovering
                  diagnostic markers that can accurately discriminate
                  between different classes of a disease. However,
                  factors such as the small sample size of typical
                  clinical data, the inherent noise in high-throughput
                  measurements, and the heterogeneity across different
                  samples, often make it difficult to find reliable
                  gene markers. To overcome this problem, several
                  studies have proposed the use of pathway-based
                  markers, instead of individual gene markers, for
                  building the classifier. Given a set of known
                  pathways, these methods estimate the activity level
                  of each pathway by summarizing the expression values
                  of its member genes, and use the pathway activities
                  for classification. It has been shown that
                  pathway-based classifiers typically yield more
                  reliable results compared to traditional gene-based
                  classifiers. In this paper, we propose a new
                  classification method based on probabilistic
                  inference of pathway activities. For a given sample,
                  we compute the log-likelihood ratio between
                  different disease phenotypes based on the expression
                  level of each gene. The activity of a given pathway
                  is then inferred by combining the log-likelihood
                  ratios of the constituent genes. We apply the
                  proposed method to the classification of breast
                  cancer metastasis, and show that it achieves higher
                  accuracy and identifies more reproducible pathway
                  markers compared to several existing pathway
                  activity inference methods.  },

                  from a human embryonic kidney and a B cell line. We
                  used shotgun sequencing of transcripts to generate
                  randomly distributed reads. Of these, 50\% mapped to
                  unique genomic locations, of which 80\% corresponded

                  may identify hundreds or thousands of genes as
                  differentially expressed (DE) between sample
                  groups. Gaining biological insight from the result
                  of such experiments can be approached, for instance,
                  by identifying the signaling pathways impacted by
                  the observed changes. Most of the existing pathway
                  analysis methods focus on either the number of DE
                  genes observed in a given pathway (enrichment
                  analysis methods), or on the correlation between the
                  pathway genes and the class of the samples
                  (functional class scoring methods). Both approaches
                  treat the pathways as simple sets of genes,
                  disregarding the complex gene interactions that
                  these pathways are built to describe. Results: We
                  describe a novel signaling pathway impact analysis
                  (SPIA) that combines the evidence obtained from the
                  classical enrichment analysis with a novel type of
                  evidence, which measures the actual perturbation on
                  a given pathway under a given condition. A bootstrap
                  procedure is used to assess the significance of the
                  observed total pathway perturbation. Using
                  simulations we show that the evidence derived from
                  perturbations is independent of the pathway
                  enrichment evidence. This allows us to calculate a
                  global pathway significance P-value, which combines
                  the enrichment and perturbation P-values. We
                  illustrate the capabilities of the novel method on
                  four real datasets. The results obtained on these
                  data show that SPIA has better specificity and more
                  sensitivity than several widely used pathway
                  analysis methods. Availability: SPIA was implemented

                  characterization of its genetic defects. DNA
                  microarray technologies can provide detailed raw
                  data about chromosomal aberrations in tumor
                  samples. Computational analysis is needed (1) to
                  deduce from raw array data actual amplification or
                  deletion events for chromosomal fragments and (2) to
                  distinguish causal chromosomal alterations from
                  functionally neutral ones. We present a
                  comprehensive computational approach, RAE, designed
                  to robustly map chromosomal alterations in tumor
                  samples and assess their functional importance in
                  cancer. To demonstrate the methodology, we
                  experimentally profile copy number changes in a
                  clinically aggressive subtype of soft-tissue
                  sarcoma, pleomorphic liposarcoma, and
                  computationally derive a portrait of candidate
                  oncogenic alterations and their target genes. Many
                  affected genes are known to be involved in
                  sarcomagenesis; others are novel, including
                  mediators of adipocyte differentiation, and may
                  include valuable therapeutic targets. Taken
                  together, we present a statistically robust
                  methodology applicable to high-resolution genomic

                  exhibit unusually high gene expression in some but
                  not all samples. This can be particularly useful in
                  cancer studies, where mutations that can amplify or
                  turn off gene expression often occur in only a
                  minority of samples. In real and simulated examples,
                  the new method often exhibits lower false discovery
                  rates than simple t-statistic thresholding. We also
                  compare our approach to the recent cancer profile
                  outlier analysis proposal of Tomlins and others

                  different steps of the assay, we are able to
                  separate the noise caused by sample preparation and
                  the hybridization processes. We quantitatively
                  characterize the strength of these different sources
                  of noise and their respective dependence on the gene
                  expression level. We find that the sample
                  preparation noise is small, implying that the
                  amplification process during the sample preparation
                  is relatively accurate. The hybridization noise is
                  found to have very strong dependence on the
                  expression level, with different characteristics for
                  the low and high expression values. The
                  hybridization noise characteristics at the high
                  expression regime are mostly Poisson-like, whereas
                  its characteristics for the small expression levels
                  are more complex, probably due to
                  cross-hybridization. A method to evaluate the
                  significance of gene expression fold changes based
                  on noise characteristics is proposed. },

  abstract =	 {Motivation: Microarray-based gene expression studies
                  have great potential but are frequently difficult to
                  interpret due to their overwhelming
                  dimensions. Recent studies have shown that the
                  analysis of expression data can be improved by its
                  integration with protein interaction networks, but
                  the performance of these analyses has been hampered
                  by the uneven quality of the interaction data.
                  Results: We present Co-Expression Zone ANalysis
                  using NEtworks (CEZANNE), a novel confidence-based
                  method for extraction of functionally coherent
                  co-expressed gene sets. CEZANNE uses probabilities
                  for individual interactions, which can be computed
                  by any available method. We propose a probabilistic
                  model and a weighting scheme in which the likelihood
                  of the connectivity of a subnetwork is related to
                  the weight of its minimum cut. Applying CEZANNE to
                  an expression dataset of DNA damage response in
                  Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we recover both known and
                  novel modules and predict novel protein
                  functions. We show that CEZANNE outperforms previous
                  methods for analysis of expression and interaction
                  data.  Availability: CEZANNE is available as part of

                  imprinting. Our knowledge of minisatellite biology
                  has greatly increased in the past 10 years owing to
                  the identification and careful analysis of human
                  hypermutable minisatellites, experimental models in
                  yea st, and recent in vitro studies of minisatellite
                  recombination properties. In parallel,
                  minisatellites have been put forward as potential
                  biomarkers for the monitoring of genotoxic agents
                  such as ionizing radiation. We summarize and discuss
                  recen t observations on minisatellites. In addition
                  we take advantage of recent whole chromosome
                  sequence data releases to provide a unifying view
                  which may facilitate the annotation of tandem repeat

  abstract =	 {Motivation: Non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) act as
                  regulators of global protein output. While their
                  major effect is on protein levels of target genes,
                  it has been proven that they also specifically
                  impact on the messenger RNA level of
                  targets. Prominent interest in miRNAs strongly
                  motivates the need for increasing the options
                  available to detect their cellular activity.
                  Results: We used the effect of miRNAs over their
                  targets for the detection of miRNA activity using
                  mRNAs expression profiles. Here we describe the
                  method, called T-REX (from Targets' Reverse
                  EXpression), compare it to other similar
                  applications, show its effectiveness and apply it to
                  build activity maps. We used six different target
                  predictions from each of four algorithms:
                  TargetScan, PicTar, DIANA-microT and DIANA
                  Union. First, we proved the sensitivity and
                  specificity of our technique in miRNA
                  over-expression and knock-out animal models. Then,
                  we used whole transcriptome data from acute myeloid
                  leukemia to show that we could identify critical
                  miRNAs in a real life, complex, clinically relevant

  abstract =	 {Motivation: A central problem in genomic research is
                  the identification of genes and pathways involved in
                  diseases and other biological processes. The genes
                  identified or the univariate test statistics are
                  often linked to known biological pathways through
                  gene set enrichment analysis in order to identify
                  the pathways involved. However, most of the
                  procedures for identifying differentially expressed
                  (DE) genes do not utilize the known pathway
                  information in the phase of identifying such
                  genes. In this article, we develop a Markov random
                  field (MRF)-based method for identifying genes and
                  subnetworks that are related to diseases. Such a
                  procedure models the dependency of the DE patterns
                  of genes on the networks using a local discrete MRF
                  model.  Results: Simulation studies indicated that
                  the method is quite effective in identifying genes
                  and subnetworks that are related to disease and has
                  higher sensitivity and lower false discovery rates
                  than the commonly used procedures that do not use
                  the pathway structure information. Applications to
                  two breast cancer microarray gene expression
                  datasets identified several subnetworks on several
                  of the KEGG transcriptional pathways that are
                  related to breast cancer recurrence or survival due
                  to breast cancer.  Conclusions: The proposed
                  MRF-based model efficiently utilizes the known
                  pathway structures in identifying the DE genes and
                  the subnetworks that might be related to
                  phenotype. As more biological networks are
                  identified and documented in databases, the proposed
                  method should find more applications in identifying
                  the subnetworks that are related to diseases and
                  other biological processes.  Contact:

  abstract =	 {Motivation: It is a common task in genomic studies
                  to identify a subset of the genes satisfying certain
                  conditions, such as differentially expressed genes
                  or regulatory target genes of a transcription factor
                  (TF). This can be formulated as a statistical
                  hypothesis testing problem. Most existing approaches
                  treat the genes as having an identical and
                  independent distribution a priori, testing each gene
                  independently or testing some subsets of the genes
                  one by one. On the other hand, it is known that the
                  genes work coordinately as dictated by gene
                  networks. Treating genes equally and independently
                  ignores the important information contained in gene
                  networks, leading to inefficient analysis and
                  reduced power.  Results: We propose incorporating
                  gene network information into statistical analysis
                  of genomic data. Specifically, rather than treating
                  the genes equally and independently a priori in a
                  standard mixture model, we assume that gene-specific
                  prior probabilities are correlated as induced by a
                  gene network: while the genes are allowed to have
                  different prior probabilities, those neighboring
                  ones in the network have similar prior
                  probabilities, reflecting their shared biological
                  functions. We applied the two approaches to a real
                  ChIP-chip dataset (and simulated data) to identify
                  the transcriptional target genes of TF GCN4. The new
                  method was found to be more powerful in discovering
                  the target genes.  Contact: weip@biostat.umn.edu },

                  sequencing present challenges to ecological and
                  statistical interpretation. In particular, library
                  sizes often vary over several ranges of magnitude,
                  and the data contains many zeros. Although we are
                  typically interested in comparing relative abundance
                  of taxa in the ecosystem of two or more groups, we
                  can only measure the taxon relative abundance in
                  specimens obtained from the ecosystems. Because the
                  comparison of taxon relative abundance in the
                  specimen is not equivalent to the comparison of
                  taxon relative abundance in the ecosystems, this
                  presents a special challenge. Second, because the
                  relative abundance of taxa in the specimen (as well
                  as in the ecosystem) sum to 1, these are
                  compositional data. Because the compositional data

                  use MM probe signal to track cross-hybridizing

  abstract =	 {Motivation: Pathway and gene set-based approaches
                  for the analysis of gene expression profiling
                  experiments have become increasingly popular for
                  addressing problems associated with individual gene
                  analysis. Since most genes are not differently
                  expressed, existing gene set tests, which consider
                  all the genes within a gene set, are subject to
                  considerable noise and power loss, a concern
                  exacerbated in studies in which the degree of
                  differential expression is moderate for truly
                  differentially expressed genes. For a significantly
                  differentially expressed pathway, it is also of
                  substantial interest to select important genes that
                  drive the differential expression of the pathway.
                  Methods: We develop a unified framework to jointly
                  test the significance of a pathway and to select a
                  subset of genes that drive the significant pathway
                  effect. To achieve dimension reduction and gene
                  selection, we decompose each gene pathway into a
                  single score by using a regularized form of linear
                  discriminant analysis, called sparse linear
                  discriminant analysis (sLDA). Testing for the
                  significance of the pathway effect proceeds via
                  permutation of the sLDA score. The sLDA-based test
                  is compared with competing approaches with
                  simulations and two applications: a study on the
                  effect of metal fume exposure on immune response and
                  a study of gene expression profiles among Type II
                  Diabetes patients.  Results: Our results show that
                  sLDA-based testing provides a powerful approach to
                  test for the significance of a differentially
                  expressed pathway and gene selection.  Availability:
                  An implementation of the proposed sLDA-based pathway
                  test in the R statistical computing environment is

  abstract =	 {Background: There is great current interest in
                  developing microarray platforms for measuring mRNA
                  abundance at both gene level and exon level. The
                  Affymetrix Exon Array is a new high-density gene
                  expression microarray platform, with over six
                  million probes targeting all annotated and predicted
                  exons in a genome. An important question for the
                  analysis of exon array data is how to compute
                  overall gene expression indexes. Because of the
                  complexity of the design of exon array probes, this
                  problem is different in nature from summarizing
                  gene-level expression from traditional expression
                  arrays. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this
                  manuscript, we use exon array data from 11 human
                  tissues to study methods for computing gene-level
                  expression. We showed that for most genes there is a
                  subset of exon array probes having highly correlated
                  intensities across multiple samples. We suggest that
                  these probes could be used as reliable indicators of
                  overall gene expression levels. We developed a probe
                  selection algorithm to select such a subset of
                  highly correlated probes for each gene, and computed
                  gene expression indexes using the selected
                  probes. Conclusions/Significance: Our results
                  demonstrate that probe selection improves gene
                  expression estimates from exon arrays. The selected
                  probes can be used in future analyses of other exon
                  array datasets to compute gene expression indexes.},

  abstract =	 {Motivation: Microarray data are susceptible to a
                  wide-range of artifacts, many of which occur on
                  physical scales comparable to the spatial dimension
                  s of the array. These artifacts introduce biases
                  that are spatially correlated. The ability of
                  current methodologies to detect and correct such
                  biases is limite d. Results: We introduce a new
                  approach for analyzing spatial artifacts, termed
                  conditional residual analysis for microarrays'
                  (CRAM). CRAM requires a microar ray design that
                  contains technical replicates of representative
                  features and a l imited number of negative controls,
                  but is free of the assumptions that constrai n
                  existing analytical procedures. The key idea is to
                  extract residuals from sets of matched replicates to
                  generate residual images. The residual images reveal
                  s patial artifacts with single-feature
                  resolution. Surprisingly, spatial artifacts were
                  found to coexist independently as additive and
                  multiplicative errors. Effi cient procedures for
                  bias estimation were devised to correct the spatial
                  artifac ts on both intensity scales. In a survey of
                  484 published single-channel dataset s, variance
                  fell 4- to 12-fold in 5\% of the datasets after bias
                  correction. Thus , inclusion of technical replicates
                  in a microarray design affords benefits far beyond
                  what one might expect with a conventional n = 5'
                  averaging, and should b e considered when designing
                  any microarray for which randomization is
                  feasible. Availability: CRAM is implemented as
                  version 2 of the hoptag software package f or R,
                  which is included in the Supplementary
                  information. Contact: dyuan@jhmi.e du Supplementary

  abstract =	 {A fundamental step in the analysis of gene
                  expression and other high-dimensional genomic data
                  is the calculation of the similarity or distance
                  between pairs of individual samples in a study. If
                  one has collected total samples and assayed the
                  expression level of genes on those samples, then an
                  similarity matrix can be formed that reflects the
                  correlation or similarity of the samples with
                  respect to the expression values over the
                  genes. This matrix can then be examined for patterns
                  via standard data reduction and cluster analysis
                  techniques. We consider an alternative to
                  conventional data reduction and cluster analyses of
                  similarity matrices that is rooted in traditional
                  linear models. This analysis method allows predictor
                  variables collected on the samples to be related to
                  variation in the pairwise similarity/distance values
                  reflected in the matrix. The proposed multivariate
                  method avoids the need for reducing the dimensions
                  of a similarity matrix, can be used to assess
                  relationships between the genes used to construct
                  the matrix and additional information collected on
                  the samples under study, and can be used to analyze
                  individual genes or groups of genes identified in
                  different ways. The technique can be used with any
                  high-dimensional assay or data type and is ideally
                  suited for testing subsets of genes defined by their
                  participation in a biochemical pathway or other
                  grouping. We showcase the methodology using three
                  published gene expression data sets.  },

                  constitute a global epidemic and a major risk factor
                  for prediabetes and type II diabetes, but existing
                  dietary methods for controlling them have limited
                  efficacy. Here, we continuously monitored week-long
                  glucose levels in an 800-person cohort, measured
                  responses to 46,898 meals, and found high

                  suggesting that universal dietary recommendations
                  may have limited utility. We devised a
                  machine-learning algorithm that integrates blood
                  parameters, dietary habits, anthropometrics,
                  physical activity, and gut microbiota measured in
                  this cohort and showed that it accurately predicts
                  personalized postprandial glycemic response to
                  real-life meals. We validated these predictions in
                  an independent 100-person cohort. Finally, a blinded
                  randomized controlled dietary intervention based on
                  this algorithm resulted in significantly lower
                  postprandial responses and consistent alterations to
                  gut microbiota configuration. Together, our results
                  suggest that personalized diets may successfully
                  modify elevated postprandial blood glucose and its
                  metabolic consequences.}

  abstract =	 {Motivation: Significant efforts have been made to
                  acquire data under different conditions and to
                  construct static networks that can explain various
                  gene regulation mechanisms. However, gene regulatory
                  networks are dynamic and condition-specific; under
                  different conditions, networks exhibit different
                  regulation patterns accompanied by different
                  transcriptional network topologies. Thus, an
                  investigation on the topological changes in
                  transcriptional networks can facilitate the
                  understanding of cell development or provide novel
                  insights into the pathophysiology of certain
                  diseases, and help identify the key genetic players
                  that could serve as biomarkers or drug
                  targets. Results: Here, we report a differential
                  dependency network (DDN) analysis to detect
                  statistically significant topological changes in the
                  transcriptional networks between two biological
                  conditions. We propose a local dependency model to
                  represent the local structures of a network by a set
                  of conditional probabilities. We develop an
                  efficient learning algorithm to learn the local
                  dependency model using the Lasso technique. A
                  permutation test is subsequently performed to
                  estimate the statistical significance of each
                  learned local structure. In testing on a simulation
                  dataset, the proposed algorithm accurately detected
                  all the genes with network topological changes. The
                  method was then applied to the estrogen-dependent
                  T-47D estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer
                  cell line datasets and human and mouse embryonic
                  stem cell datasets. In both experiments using real
                  microarray datasets, the proposed method produced
                  biologically meaningful results. We expect DDN to
                  emerge as an important bioinformatics tool in
                  transcriptional network analyses. While we focus
                  specifically on transcriptional networks, the DDN
                  method we introduce here is generally applicable to
                  other biological networks with similar
                  characteristics. Availability: The DDN MATLAB

  abstract =	 {Gene set analysis allows the inclusion of knowledge
                  from established gene sets, such as gene pathways,
                  and potentially improves the power of detecting
                  differentially expressed genes. However,
                  conventional methods of gene set analysis focus on
                  gene marginal effects in a gene set, and ignore gene
                  interactions which may contribute to complex human
                  diseases. In this study, we propose a method of gene
                  interaction enrichment analysis, which incorporates
                  knowledge of predefined gene sets (e.g. gene
                  pathways) to identify enriched gene interaction
                  effects on a phenotype of interest. In our proposed
                  method, we also discuss the reduction of irrelevant
                  genes and the extraction of a core set of gene
                  interactions for an identified gene set, which
                  contribute to the statistical variation of a
                  phenotype of interest. The utility of our method is
                  demonstrated through analyses on two publicly
                  available microarray datasets. The results show that
                  our method can identify gene sets that show strong
                  gene interaction enrichments. The enriched gene
                  interactions identified by our method may provide
                  clues to new gene regulation mechanisms related to
                  the studied phenotypes. In summary, our method
                  offers a powerful tool for researchers to
                  exhaustively examine the large numbers of gene
                  interactions associated with complex human diseases,
                  and can be a useful complement to classical gene set
                  analyses which only considers single genes in a gene
                  set.  },

                  location-specific. This complicates establishing
                  relevant links between the host's health and the
                  presence or abundance of specific microbial
                  populations and argues for the implementation of
                  novel high-throughput technologies in studying the
                  diversity and functionality of the GI tract
                  microbiota. Here, we focus on the recent
                  developments and applications of phylogenetic
                  microarrays based on SSU rRNA sequences and

  ABSTRACT =	 {Clinical and environmental meta-omics studies are
                  accumulating an ever-growing amount of microbial
                  abundance data over a wide range of ecosystems. With
                  a sufficiently large sample number, these microbial
                  communities can be explored by constructing and
                  analyzing co-occurrence networks, which detect taxon
                  associations from abundance data and can give
                  insights into community structure. Here, we
                  investigate how co-occurrence networks differ across
                  biomes and which other factors influence their
                  properties. For this, we inferred microbial
                  association networks from 20 different 16S rDNA
                  sequencing data sets and observed that soil
                  microbial networks harbor proportionally fewer
                  positive associations and are less densely
                  interconnected than host-associated networks. After
                  excluding sample number, sequencing depth and
                  beta-diversity as possible drivers, we found a
                  negative correlation between community evenness and
                  positive edge percentage. This correlation likely
                  results from a skewed distribution of negative
                  interactions, which take place preferentially
                  between less prevalent taxa. Overall, our results
                  suggest an under-appreciated role of evenness in
                  shaping microbial association networks.}
