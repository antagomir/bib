  abstract =	 {Recent advances in high-throughput measurement
                  technologies and efficient sharing of biomedical
                  data through community databases have made it
                  possible to investigate the complete collection of
                  genetic material, the genome, which encodes the
                  heritable genetic program of an organism. This has
                  opened up new views to the study of living organisms
                  with a profound impact on biological research.
                  Functional genomics is a subdiscipline of molecular
                  biology that investigates the functional
                  organization of genetic information.  This thesis
                  develops computational strategies to investigate a
                  key functional layer of the genome, the
                  transcriptome. The time- and context-specific
                  transcriptional activity of the genes regulates the
                  function of living cells through protein
                  synthesis. Efficient computational techniques are
                  needed in order to extract useful information from
                  high-dimensional genomic observations that are
                  associated with high levels of complex
                  variation. Statistical learning and probabilistic
                  models provide the theoretical framework for
                  combining statistical evidence across multiple
                  observations and the wealth of background
                  information in genomic data repositories.  This
                  thesis addresses three key challenges in
                  transcriptome analysis. First, new preprocessing
                  techniques that utilize side information in genomic
                  sequence databases and microarray collections are
                  developed to improve the accuracy of high-throughput
                  microarray measurements.  Second, a novel
                  exploratory approach is proposed in order to
                  construct a global view of cell-biological network
                  activation patterns and functional relatedness
                  between tissues across normal human
                  body. Information in genomic interaction databases
                  is used to derive constraints that help to focus the
                  modeling in those parts of the data that are
                  supported by known or potential interactions between
                  the genes, and to scale up the analysis. The third
                  contribution is to develop novel approaches to model
                  dependency between co-occurring measurement
                  sources. The methods are used to study cancer
                  mechanisms and transcriptome evolution; integrative
                  analysis of the human transcriptome and other layers
                  of genomic information allows the identification of
                  functional mechanisms and interactions that could
                  not be detected based on the individual measurement
                  sources. Open source implementations of the key
                  methodological contributions have been released to
                  facilitate their further adoption by the research
                  community.}
